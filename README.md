# small lisp written in Odin 
main points:
- modernized Lisp 1.5 written in a non-GC language (Odin)
- using Tunney's tiny garbage collector (true FP) instead of mutation and shared memory RAM-style GC
- uses Unicode instead of ASCII

# Status
- Read and format implemented (i.e. the hard part)
- still need to implement Eval() and Apply() and TGC()

# TODO:
